# ML Web App with Random Forest

This project is a machine learning web application that uses a Random Forest model trained on a dataset forked from Kaggle. The application is built using HTML pages served through a Python Flask backend (`app.py`).

## 📁 Project Structure

- `dataset.csv`: The dataset used to train the Random Forest model (sourced from Kaggle).
- `untitled.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using the Random Forest algorithm.
- `app.py`: Flask backend file used to serve HTML pages and integrate the trained model.
- `templates/`: Folder containing multiple HTML pages rendered by `app.py`.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask  
- **ML Model**: Random Forest (via scikit-learn)  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS  
- **Notebook**: Jupyter (`.ipynb`)
